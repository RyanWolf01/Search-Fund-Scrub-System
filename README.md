# Search-Fund-Scrub-System
A google apps script project to increase company list scrubbing efficiency. Interns fill out information on individual companies through a google form prefilled with the companies' pre-existing data (i.e. name and address). Upon form submission, their submission data is manipulated and entered into a google sheets database. The intern is presented a link which then redirects them to the URL of the next company to scrub.

The Google Form interface is optimal for scrubbing, requiring fewer button clicks compared to alternatives like HubSpot.
