# Search-Fund-Scrub-System
A Google Apps Script project to increase company list scrubbing efficiency. Interns fill out information on individual companies through a Google Form prefilled with the companies' pre-existing data (i.e. name and address). Upon form submission, the submission data is manipulated and entered into a Google Sheet. The intern is presented a link which redirects them to the Google Form of the next company to scrub.

The Google Form interface is optimal for scrubbing, requiring fewer button clicks compared to alternatives like HubSpot.

The project is currently in-progress, and video tutorials and the corresponding google form will be posted a few days after 5/25/2022.
